## Project Hypotheses
1. **Oraganizations and Location**
   - **Null hypothesis:** There is no significant difference in revenue generated by organizations located in affluent areas of Massachusetts and organizations located in lower-income neighborhoods
   - **Alternative Hypothesis:** There is a significant difference in revenue generated by organizations located in affluent areas of Massachusetts and organizations located in  lower-income. implying that organizations situated in wealthier neighborhoods may attract       patients with better insurance coverage or ability to pay out-of-pocket for medical services, leading to higher revenue generation compared to hospitals in economically disadvantaged areas.
     
2. **Organization Utilization and Location**
     - **Null hypothesis:** There is no significant difference in facility utilization rates between densely populated areas of Massachusetts and organizations in suburban or rural areas
     - **Alternative Hypothesis:** organizations located in urban centers face higher demand for healthcare services due to the concentration of population, resulting in more frequent use of organizations facilities such as emergency rooms, inpatient beds, and outpatient clinics compared to organizations in less populated areas.

3. **Healthcare coverage and the White Race**
    - **Null Hypothesis:** There is no correlation between the white race and healthcare coverage.
    - **Alternative Hypothesis:** white have more healthcare coverage than other races suggesting that whites have more access to healthcare than other races.

4. **Healthcare coverage and gender**
    - **Null Hypothesis:** There is no significant relationship between healthcare coverage and gender. All genders have equal access to healthcare coverage.
    - **Alternative Hypothesis:** There is a significant relationship between health coverage and gender where males have more access to healthcare coverage than females.

## Tools
- Excel - Data cleaning
- Alteryx - Alteryx was used to clean the data. It came in handy in changing the data types of all the fields, removing unwanted characters in the patients names etc. One significant data cleaning step in Alteryx was changing the date type of the Patients file and calculating the age of the patients.
- Python - Python also came in handy in data cleansing when all the other tools were challenged to calculate the age of the patients.
- MySQLWorkbench
- PowerBI
